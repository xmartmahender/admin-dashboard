# Admin Dashboard Security Setup Guide

## 🔐 Initial Admin User Setup

Since this admin dashboard now uses Firebase Authentication for security, you need to create the first admin user. Here's how to set it up:

### Step 1: Create Admin User in Firebase Console

1. **Go to Firebase Console**: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. **Select your project**: `new-project-f8d5e`
3. **Navigate to Authentication**:
   - Click on "Authentication" in the left sidebar
   - Go to the "Users" tab
   - Click "Add user"

4. **Create the admin user**:
   - Email: `admin@kidzzone.com` (or your preferred admin email)
   - Password: Create a strong password (at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters)
   - Click "Add user"

### Step 2: Add Admin Role to Firestore

1. **Go to Firestore Database**:
   - Click on "Firestore Database" in the left sidebar
   - Go to the "Data" tab

2. **Create admin collection**:
   - Click "Start collection"
   - Collection ID: `admins`
   - Document ID: Use the UID from the user you just created (copy from Authentication > Users)

3. **Add admin document fields**:
   ```
   Field: role
   Type: string
   Value: admin

   Field: email
   Type: string
   Value: admin@kidzzone.com (or the email you used)

   Field: displayName
   Type: string
   Value: Admin

   Field: createdAt
   Type: timestamp
   Value: (current timestamp)

   Field: isActive
   Type: boolean
   Value: true
   ```

### Step 3: Deploy Security Rules

1. **Install Firebase CLI** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   ```

2. **Login to Firebase**:
   ```bash
   firebase login
   ```

3. **Initialize Firebase in your project** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   firebase init firestore
   ```

4. **Deploy the security rules**:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
   ```

### Step 4: Test the Setup

1. **Start the admin dashboard**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Try logging in** with the admin credentials you created

3. **Test password change functionality** in the Settings section
